The package supports dynamic group behavior, customizable colors, and robust state management, making it ideal for modern, interactive user interfaces.

## Features
- Create toggle buttons with customizable states.
- Group buttons for coordinated toggling.
- Easily manage toggle states programmatically.

## Installation
Install via pip:
```bash
pip install ctk_toggle
```
## Usage

### Contributions from Large Language Models

This project was developed with support and inspiration from state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including but not limited to open/free-to-use models such as:

- OpenAI's GPT series.
- Open-source language models provided by communities like Hugging Face and EleutherAI.

These models were instrumental in providing guidance, code refactoring suggestions, and improving the overall quality of the project documentation. Special thanks to the developers, researchers, and communities who have contributed to the field of natural language processing and made these models publicly available for everyone.

The integration of such tools demonstrates how artificial intelligence can augment human creativity and productivity in software development and beyond.
